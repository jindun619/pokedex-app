# PokedexApp

PokedexApp is a cross-platform mobile application built with **React Native** and **TypeScript**. It serves as a digital Pok√©dex, allowing users to browse, search, and view detailed information about Pok√©mon. The app leverages **PokeAPI**, a free and open-source RESTful API, to fetch Pok√©mon data. 

## Features

- **Home Screen**: Displays a list of Pok√©mon in index order, with **infinite scroll** to fetch more data as the user scrolls.
- **Search Screen**: Allows users to search for specific Pok√©mon by name.
- **Detail Screen**: Shows detailed information about a selected Pok√©mon, including stats, abilities, and more.
- **Navigation**: Clicking on a Pok√©mon card from any screen routes the user to the corresponding **Detail Screen** using **React Navigation**.
